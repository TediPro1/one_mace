        // This is a generic check. A more specific check might involve inspecting the entry
        // to see if it *could* generate a Mace. For simplicity, we make a broad assumption
        // or rely on a more direct item-insertion check.
        // Due to the difficulty of getting the actual item from a LootPoolEntry.Builder<?>,
        // and the server instance at this stage, this mixin might be less effective than desired
        // for proactive prevention. A post-generation check (e.g., when an item is picked up)
        // would be more reliable, but the prompt specifically asked for loot table modification.

        // For now, we will add a placeholder for future refinement if possible.
        // If MaceTrackerState.get(server) is called with a null server here, it will rely on
        // the static INSTANCE if it's already initialized. This is a potential point of failure
        // or inaccuracy if the state hasn't been loaded yet or is being manipulated concurrently.
        // It's generally safer to get the server instance directly if possible, or defer the check.

        // A more robust approach for loot tables might be to register a LootItemFunction that runs
        // when items are generated from the loot table, and then filters out Maces if maceExists is true.
        // However, this requires more substantial code for a custom loot function.

        // Given the constraints and the request for mixin to loot tables, this is a best-effort attempt.
        // We are assuming that if MaceTrackerState.maceExists(null) returns true, it's because the server
        // has already started and the state is loaded.

        // This logic will be further refined or potentially removed if it proves too difficult to implement reliably
        // at this stage without a direct server instance or a more complex custom loot function.
        if (MaceTrackerState.maceExists(null)) {
            // If a Mace exists, we want to prevent any further Maces from being added to loot pools.
            // This is a very broad cancellation. Ideally, we'd only cancel if the 'entry' itself
            // directly leads to a Mace. But inferring that from LootPoolEntry.Builder<?> is hard.
            SingletonMace.LOGGER.info("Preventing Mace from loot table because one already exists (LootPool.Builder mixin).");
            // Returning the original builder effectively skips adding the current entry if it's a Mace.
            // This isn't a perfect solution as it removes any item if mace exists, which is undesirable.
            // This approach needs to be re-evaluated. The problem is that LootPoolEntry.Builder does not expose
            // the item it adds easily before it's built. 
            // Let's comment out the cancellable part for now and consider a different approach.
            // cir.setReturnValue(LootPool.Builder.class.cast(this)); // This line would effectively cancel the addition
        }
    }

    // Alternative: A custom LootItemFunction might be better for this purpose. If the user expects
    // the mod to work right away, we might need to skip this part or explicitly state its limitations.
    // Given the prompt, I need to try to implement it this way first, and if it fails to be reliable,
    // explain the limitations.
    // Trying a more direct approach by overriding the addItem method if such exists or using a different hook.
    // Since direct `LootPool.Builder` modification to filter specific items is hard here, we will try
    // to intercept the *creation* of item entries if possible within the loot system.
    // Re-evaluating the `LootTableEvents.MODIFY.register` in `SingletonMace.java` might be a better approach
    // with more context.

    // Let's hold off on this specific mixin as it's not straightforward to implement proactively and reliably without
    // a custom LootItemFunction. The `LootTableEvents.MODIFY` in `SingletonMace` might be a better place
    // to iterate and remove entries, but it also won't have the `server` instance directly without some passing.
